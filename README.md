# OrdeRPG

This is my pet project, in which I'm learning `Python`, `FastApi`, `SQLAlchemy` and also improving the quality of my code, making some tools for my future and in general spending time at the computer for fun.

In general, the project is divided into 2 parts - the `utils` directory and everything else.

`Utils` is kind of my personal library for the future, the rest of the project is a browser-based rpg game (though, rather, only its backend).

All the code in the project is invented and written by me personally (with a few exceptions with notes about the source).
